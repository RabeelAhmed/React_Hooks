# **React Hooks Practice** 🎯

Welcome to my **React Hooks Practice** repository! In this project, I've explored and implemented various React Hooks, including:

- **useContext** 🌐
- **useLayoutEffect** 🧩
- **useEffect** 🔄
- **useCallback** 🔁
- **useMemo** 🧠
- **useReducer** ⚙️
- **useRef** 🔗
- **useState** 🎛️

Each hook is demonstrated with simple, clean examples to showcase their usage and best practices in React development. This practice was focused on improving my understanding of managing state, side effects, performance optimizations, and more.

## **Project Features** 🚀
